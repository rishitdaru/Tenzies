## Description

Tenzies: The world's fastest game!

You get 10 dice. Click 'Roll' to roll all dice simultaneously. Then inspect the dice and determine which number you will shoot for. Then, in rapid succession, continue rolling the remaining dice until they all display the same number.

The game also displays the number of rolls. Once you win, the app displays confetti and gives an option to restart the game. Try to play this game and see if you can beat your friends!!!
